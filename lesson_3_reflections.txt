When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working on a project from multiple computers.
    When offsite backup is a consideration.
    When want to easily share / publish a project, and the remote repository
    is more easily accessible (or searchable/findable).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    A branch created locally might also get created by someone else, and pushed
    to the remote.  An automatic update would either need to overwrite or merge
    the duplicate branches, neither of which is probably correct.
    The local repository might be a fork, so changes to the remote might not be
    wanted at all, at least without verification that the changes fit with (the reason for) the forked version.
    Minimize local (or remote) resource usage: storage space, bandwith.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working on a project from multiple computers.
    When offsite backup is a consideration.
    When want to easily share / publish a project, and the remote repository
    is more easily accessible (or searchable/findable).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    A branch created locally might also get created by someone else, and pushed
    to the remote.  An automatic update would either need to overwrite or merge
    the duplicate branches, neither of which is probably correct.
    The local repository might be a fork, so changes to the remote might not be
    wanted at all, at least without verification that the changes fit with (the reason for) the forked version.
    Minimize local (or remote) resource usage: storage space, bandwith.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a repository copy done by GitHub, from GitHub, to GitHub.
    Clone creates a local copy of a respository.  The source of the copy can be
    either local or remote.  The created repository is setup to use the source
    repository as the remote/origin.
    A branch is just a name applied to commit, that becomes the tip for any
    future commits done with that branch checked out.  After commits on both
    that branch, and the branch that was original associated with the starting
    commit, that commit will be the parent to 2 different commits.  The
    starting commit could already have child commits associated at the time the
    branch is created.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Allows local access to information about the synchronization state between
    the local and remote.  The lets git provide earlier warning about some
    siturations that are likely to need user intervention.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    That would depend greatly on the context.  There are several other version
    control systems, online and offline to use as alternatives.  There are also
    specific collaboration tools, including google docs, drop box, ervernote,
    and more.  Sneaker net with USB flash drives also works, or zip/tar archives
    and email.  Easier or harder items would depend on the context, project
    size, update frequency, amount of concurrent changes, and much more.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Experimental changes that need to be reviewed (by others) before being added
    to the main (master) branch.
    A single (conceptual) change that needs input from multiple people before
    being complete.
    A single (conceptual) change that needs time to complete before being ready
    for the main stream.
    A set of changes that need to be rolled out as a set, while still doing
    other changes to the production version.

    Changes to master (typically) get in front of more eyes sooner.  Faster
    update cycles.
    Using (temporary) branches makes peer review easier as part of the standard
    work flow.

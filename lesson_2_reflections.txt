What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing creates a (hidden) ".git" subdirectory in the current /
	specified directory.  That directory contains a bunch of additional files
	and subdirectories containing the repository information.  Effectively, the
	.git directory is a database that holds (will hold) all of the commit
	(state) information.  This is needed to tell git / the system that the
	directory is to be tracked / managed by git; that it is a working directory
	for a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area contains only those files that are candidates for the next
	commit.  The repository contains all versions of all files, plus additional
	information, for all previous commits.  The working directory can really
	contain anything: Each file in the working directory could match a file in
	the stating area, any commited version of a file, a file that does not
	exist in either the staging area or repository.  Files that existing in the
	staging area or repository might not existing (any longer) in the working
	directory.

	The staging area provides a way to group changes in preparation for a
	single logical commit.  Even if the modified files in the working directory
	are for multiple logical changes, only those files associated with one of
	the (logical) changes needs to be put into the staging area.  This only
	works of course, if all modifications in a single file are for a single
	change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
